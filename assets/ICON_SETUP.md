# Icon Setup Instructions

To add a custom icon to your Warframe Overlay app:

1. Create or find a 256x256 pixel image for your app icon
2. Convert it to .ico format (you can use online converters like https://convertio.co/png-ico/)
3. Save it as "icon.ico" in this assets folder
4. The build process will automatically use it

For now, the app will build with a default Electron icon if no custom icon is provided.

## Recommended Icon Specifications:
- Format: .ico (Windows icon format)
- Size: 256x256 pixels minimum
- Multiple sizes embedded: 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256
- Transparent background recommended

## Quick Icon Creation:
- Use GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools
- Warframe-themed colors (blue/cyan recommended)
- Simple, recognizable design that scales well
